Hey there!
Martin Barriault,

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm a big fan of snowboarding
and backcountry skiing,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and the wonderful scenery of the
Mont-Saint-Pierre valley.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Mont-Saint-Pierre is
a superb landscape.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
With the U-shaped valleys
and the big mountains,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
it's a pretty good drop.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Just this scenery here, it's incredible.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This piece of land was set up
for backcountry skiing

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
with different slopes,
different hillsides too.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Slope angles can be
up to 40, 45 degrees

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
so we're talking really,
really big drops.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The clientele, generally,
will be people

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that have been skiing
for a while,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
so they'll have a pretty strong base
in terms of skiing.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You need to be
in good physical shape.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The climb is part of the sport,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and the treat is the descent.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
First, when you're going up
in your sealskins,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
you're already in contact
with the nature around you.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And when you reach the top,
when you're about to go down,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
you tell yourself: “Hey wow, this is
going to be awesome!”

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So really, to me,
that's what I call freedom.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You will feel incredibly lucky,
incredibly powerful

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
just being on top
of that mountain,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and you'll say: “I climbed,
I did it, now watch me go down!”
