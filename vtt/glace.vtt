Hey there!
Vincent Pellerin Boudriau,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
amateur ice climber and lover
of Mont-Saint-Pierre.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What I find really extraordinary
about ice climbing

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is that you're only focused
on the moment

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and on the action that
you're doing.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You want to be as sure as
possible of your footing,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
make sure your step is secure
because you're going to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
rely on it to go and
stick your ice axe a little higher,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and you have to be used
to doing this kind of thing.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
On Mont Saint-Pierre itself,
there are a few ice cascades

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that you can go on
from the road.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
On the other side of the valley,
on the mountain,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
facing Mont Saint-Pierre,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
now there's a place with a lot
of wiggle room to do that.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The walls over there
are between 70 to 80, 90 meters high.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
That's one of the reasons why

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
we often come here
to Mont-Saint-Pierre.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Some of the paths are accessible
on foot.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We walk out of the cabin directly
with our boots on, ice axes in hand,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
screws, quickdraws
on the harness.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Having a view of the river,
a view of the bay,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and being really isolated
in nature,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that's what makes you want to come
back year after year, actually.
