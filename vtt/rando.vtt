Clémence Pépin,

2
00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:05.472
hiking lover.

3
00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:07.807
Come wander around
Mont-Saint-Pierre.

4
00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:15.682
In Mont-Saint-Pierre,

5
00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.418
we're pretty spoiled
in terms of geology.

6
00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:22.355
I didn't expect to discover
such beautiful scenery.

7
00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:25.959
There are mountains that
you'd never have expected.

8
00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:28.328
You've got the sea, the valley.

9
00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.463
There's the hinterland, too.

10
00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:33.566
Trails everywhere.

11
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:37.203
There's the Sentier des Côtes,
the Sentier de la Rivière.

12
00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:39.339
This here is the Sentier du Delta.

13
00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.908
Everything is close -
you can park downhill.

14
00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:44.944
You go up, not even
two kilometres.

15
00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:47.580
It's one of the most beautiful
marked trails.

16
00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:51.017
There's no erosion,
no steep slopes.

17
00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:53.219
They built some stairs,

18
00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.688
including one to reach
the cross.

19
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.795
But still, the climb
is not to be underestimated!

20
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.500
And then, at the top,
there's a surprising vista.

21
00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:11.304
Two gorgeous valleys
on either side.

22
00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:13.573
It's really lovely,
majestic even.

23
00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:16.242
If you're lucky,
you can see hang gliders

24
00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:20.780
or paragliders just
launching into the air.

25
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.149
It's exquisite, like something out of a dream.

26
00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.052
So, when people come to visit,
I take them here.

27
00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:28.922
I'll let you see for yourself!
