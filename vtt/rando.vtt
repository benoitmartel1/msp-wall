Clémence Pépin,

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
hiking lover.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Come wander around
Mont-Saint-Pierre.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In Mont-Saint-Pierre,

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
we're pretty spoiled
in terms of geology.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I didn't expect to discover
such beautiful scenery.

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
There are mountains that
you'd never have expected.

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You've got the sea, the valley.

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There's the hinterland, too.

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Trails everywhere.

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
There's the Sentier des Côtes,
the Sentier de la Rivière.

12
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This here is the Sentier du Delta.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Everything is close -
you can park downhill.

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You go up, not even
two kilometres.

15
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It's one of the most beautiful
marked trails.

16
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
There's no erosion,
no steep slopes.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
They built some stairs,

18
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
including one to reach
the cross.

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But still, the climb
is not to be underestimated!

20
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And then, at the top,
there's a surprising vista.

21
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Two gorgeous valleys
on either side.

22
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It's really lovely,
majestic even.

23
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
If you're lucky,
you can see hang gliders

24
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
or paragliders just
launching into the air.

25
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It's exquisite, like something out of a dream.

26
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So, when people come to visit,
I take them here.

27
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I'll let you see for yourself!
