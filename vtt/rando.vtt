00:00:02.268 --> 00:00:03.870
Clémence Pépin,

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.438
hiking lover.

3
00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:07.774
Come wander around
Mont-Saint-Pierre.

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.648
In Mont-Saint-Pierre,

5
00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:18.385
we're pretty spoiled
in terms of geology.

6
00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:22.322
I didn't expect
to discover such beautiful scenery, you know.

7
00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.657
There are mountains
that you would never

8
00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:25.925
have expected.

9
00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:28.294
You've got the sea, the valley,

10
00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:30.430
there's the hinterland, too.

11
00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:33.533
Trails everywhere.

12
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:37.170
There's the Sentier des Côtes,
the Sentier de la Rivière.

13
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.305
This here is the Sentier du Delta.

14
00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.875
Everything is close,
you can park downhill.

15
00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.911
You go up, not even
two kilometres.

16
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:47.547
It's one of the most beautiful
marked trails.

17
00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:50.984
There's no erosion,
no steep slopes.

18
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:53.186
They built some stairs,

19
00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:55.655
including one to reach
the cross.

20
00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:01.761
But still, the climb
is not to be underestimated!

21
00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:07.467
And then, at the top,
there's a surprising vista.

22
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:11.271
Two gorgeous valleys
on either side.

23
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:13.540
It's really lovely,
majestic even,

24
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.209
and, if you're lucky,
you can see the hang gliders

25
00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:20.747
or paragliders
just launching into the air.

26
00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.782
It's exquisite, like something out of a dream.

27
00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:26.019
So, when people come to visit,
I take them here.

28
00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:28.154
I'll let you see for yourself!
