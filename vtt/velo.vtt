Pierre Reznyak,

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
bike aficionado
and lover of Mont-Saint-Pierre.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Coming in from the West,

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
if you don't stop here,

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
you've lost
your sense of wonder.

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
There's something for everyone

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and I think that all
bike lovers

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
can find
a little something

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to fit their tastes.

10
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Mountain biking
or “fatbike”,

11
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
are the two modes that are

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
most adapted to the region.

13
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
There are many climbs.

14
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Some slopes
are pretty steep.

15
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I think electric bikes

16
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
make biking more accessible,

17
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
allowing more people

18
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to practice and have fun

19
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
throughout the area.

20
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Sometimes, you get to see
moose or deer.

21
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
These elements are
based on natural beauty.

22
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We have vistas
that are unique.

23
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Every lookout is unique.

24
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Everything you see

25
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
is so beautiful.

26
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So you always
want to keep going.

27
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
There are few places in
Quebec that allow you to do that.
