00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.368
Pierre Reznyak,

2
00:00:01.368 --> 00:00:03.937
bike aficionado
and lover of Mont-Saint-Pierre.

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.342
Coming in from the West,

4
00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:10.777
if you don't stop here,

5
00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:13.213
you've lost
your sense of wonder.

6
00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:15.081
There's something for everyone

7
00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:17.650
and I think that all
bike lovers

8
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.719
can find
a little something

9
00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.254
to fit their tastes.

10
00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:23.757
Mountain biking
or “fatbike”,

11
00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:25.458
are the two modes that are

12
00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:27.394
most adapted to the region.

13
00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.596
There are many climbs.

14
00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:32.732
Some slopes
are pretty steep.

15
00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:34.567
I think electric bikes

16
00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:36.436
make biking more accessible,

17
00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.371
allowing more people

18
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.241
to practice and have fun

19
00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.343
throughout the area.

20
00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:47.180
Sometimes, you get to see
moose or deer.

21
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.983
These elements are
based on natural beauty.

22
00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:52.352
We have vistas
that are unique.

23
00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:54.988
Every lookout is unique.

24
00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.523
Everything you see

25
00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:57.824
is so beautiful.

26
00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:00.427
So you always
want to keep going.

27
00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:03.930
There are few places in
Quebec that allow you to do that.
