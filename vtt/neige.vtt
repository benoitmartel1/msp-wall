Hey there!
David LÃ©vesque,

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
snowmobile aficionado.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Come discover our mountains!

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I remember,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
from the time I was four
or five years old,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I didn't want to go to school,
I just wanted to go

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
for a snowmobile ride
with my dad.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
A few years down the line, I bought
my first snowmobile. I was 17.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It makes you feel free.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's like driving,
but on a snowy road.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You go up the mountain,
really close to the river.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Then, you go down
into the valley, and you go back up.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, you go deep into the woods,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and there's still
a few good climbs,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
so you get some really
exceptional vistas,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
because the mountains are almost
500 meters above sea level.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's really quick,
the change in scenery.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The new tracks and new stretches
that have been developed,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
give access to all sorts of places
people didn't use to go before.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So for example, we've got
Mont BernÃªche,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
which is to the West
of Mont-Saint-Pierre,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and also East
of Mont-Saint-Pierre,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
with the viewpoint
that was built,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
now that it's being maintained
with a resurfacer,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
it's become really easy
to go up and see those vistas.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The view is really amazing!

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Even though I live in Mont-Louis,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'll still stop for an hour because
I'm really happy to see it,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and it's different every time.
