00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Pierre Coulombe,

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
off-road vehicle enthusiast.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Welcome to this
postcard scenery!

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What is special about
Mont-Saint-Pierre's trails

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is the access points that we built
to all the vistas.

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We made everything accessible
for both locals and tourists.

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You need a certain amount of skill,

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but the drop becomes
a real pleasure.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Every little bit
feels like an accomplishment.

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It's the emotions
it makes us feel,

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the mountains,
going up and down,

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and as a reward,

13
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
you get that “wow” effect
from the panoramic views.

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
ATVs handle very well,
and they're lighter.

15
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Side-by-sides let you ride
next to one another.

16
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
People share
emotions live, on the spot.

17
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Both are excellent vehicles.

18
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
On top of that,
we get front-row seats

19
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
to this magical environment!
