00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:01.735
Pierre Coulombe,

2
00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:04.037
off-road vehicle enthusiast.

3
00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:07.607
Welcome to this
postcard scenery!

4
00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:14.080
What is special about
Mont-Saint-Pierre's trails

5
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.350
is the access points that we built
to all the vistas.

6
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.555
We made everything accessible
for both locals and tourists.

7
00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:24.624
You need a certain amount of skill,

8
00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:27.460
but the drop becomes
a real pleasure.

9
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.064
Every little bit
feels like an accomplishment.

10
00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:33.600
It's the emotions
it makes us feel,

11
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.102
the mountains,
going up and down,

12
00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:37.437
and as a reward,

13
00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:40.507
you get that “wow” effect
from the panoramic views.

14
00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:43.710
ATVs handle very well,
and they're lighter.

15
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.513
Side-by-sides let you ride
next to one another.

16
00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:49.916
People share
emotions live, on the spot.

17
00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:53.119
Both are excellent vehicles.

18
00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:55.789
On top of that,
we get front-row seats

19
00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.924
to this magical environment!
