00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello! I'm Annie Bédard.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I’ve lived in Mont-Saint-Pierre
for the past five years…

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and this is my beach!

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This beach is for everyone.

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It adapts to you,
whoever you are.

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In the summer, it’s full
of treasures.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I see it as my playground -
it’s my favourite place in the world!

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Hello! I'm David.

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Everyone here calls me
the damn Frenchman.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Come on down to Mont-Saint-Pierre!

11
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In the summer, I love kayaking

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and hiking because
I’m crazy about nature.

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And at around 6:30 at night,
it’s the big rendez-vous: fishing!

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We take out the fishing rods,
we go to the beach,

15
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
we try to catch some mackerel
or striped bass.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Sometimes you get nothing
and your neighbour

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
gets everything…
but you start over the next day!

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
On the beach, we fish!

19
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
There’s no need for a boat.

20
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You can fish with both feet
on the sand.

21
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
You can kitesurf, kayak
and swim!

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
That’s what
this place is:

23
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
a whole world that can be adapted
to everyone’s needs!
