00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:03.136
Hello! I'm Annie Bédard.

2
00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:05.905
I’ve lived in Mont-Saint-Pierre
for the past five years…

3
00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:08.608
and this is my beach!

4
00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.580
This beach is for everyone.

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.516
It adapts to you,
whoever you are.

6
00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.718
In the summer, it’s full
of treasures.

7
00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:22.722
I see it as my playground -
it’s my favourite place in the world!

8
00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:28.128
Hello! I'm David.

9
00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:30.697
Everyone here calls me
the damn Frenchman.

10
00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.599
Come on down to Mont-Saint-Pierre!

11
00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.735
In the summer, I love kayaking

12
00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:38.438
and hiking because
I’m crazy about nature.

13
00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:42.909
And at around 6:30 at night,
it’s the big rendez-vous: fishing!

14
00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.079
We take out the fishing rods,
we go to the beach,

15
00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.581
we try to catch some mackerel
or striped bass.

16
00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:51.217
Sometimes you get nothing
and your neighbour

17
00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.787
gets everything…
but you start over the next day!

18
00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:56.790
On the beach, we fish!

19
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.426
There’s no need for a boat.

20
00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:02.595
You can fish with both feet
on the sand.

21
00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:06.599
You can kitesurf, kayak
and swim!

22
00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:08.268
That’s what
this place is:

23
00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:13.540
a whole world that can be adapted
to everyone’s needs!
