Hello!
Patrick Golliot,

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
hang glider pilot
since 1977.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I've been coming
to Mont-Saint-Pierre since 1978.

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It goes way back,
my story with hang gliding.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It began with
a dream that I had

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
when I was a kid,
which was to fly.

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Hang gliding made it possible.

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Why here rather than
anywhere else?

9
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Because it's
an incredible country.

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Mont-Saint-Pierre
is hard to beat.

11
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The beauty of the scenery.

12
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The sea is right there.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This meeting of two worlds

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
creates
meteorological

15
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and atmospheric events
that help us stay in the air.

16
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We call them
Magic Winds.

17
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It's nothing specific, but at
the same time, it's all of that.

18
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Hang gliding, today,

19
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
is not a dangerous sport,
it's a spectacular sport.

20
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
People who see us
get it confused sometimes.

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
If you're looking for cautious people, look no further.

22
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
When hang glider pilots take off,
they're not planning to die.

23
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
They want to land safely
after a beautiful trip.
