Hello!
Patrick Golliot,

2
00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:06.606
hang glider pilot
since 1977.

3
00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:10.343
I've been coming
to Mont-Saint-Pierre since 1978.

4
00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:21.254
It goes way back,
my story with hang gliding.

5
00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:23.456
It began with
a dream that I had

6
00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:26.359
when I was a kid,
which was to fly.

7
00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.828
Hang gliding made it possible.

8
00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:31.364
Why here rather than
anywhere else?

9
00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:33.133
Because it's
an incredible country.

10
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.769
Mont-Saint-Pierre
is hard to beat.

11
00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.537
The beauty of the scenery.

12
00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.039
The sea is right there.

13
00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.473
This meeting of two worlds

14
00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:41.941
creates
meteorological

15
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:44.744
and atmospheric events
that help us stay in the air.

16
00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:47.547
We call them
Magic Winds.

17
00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:51.551
It's nothing specific, but at
the same time, it's all of that.

18
00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.319
Hang gliding, today,

19
00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:56.189
is not a dangerous sport,
it's a spectacular sport.

20
00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:58.892
People who see us
get it confused sometimes.

21
00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:03.563
If you're looking for cautious people, look no further.

22
00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:06.733
When hang glider pilots take off,
they're not planning to die.

23
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.402
They want to land safely
after a beautiful trip.
