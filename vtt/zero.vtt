Hey there!
Hélène Coulombe,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
lover of Mont-Saint-Pierre,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
lover of its snow and its ice!

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Winter is my favourite season!
(laughs)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Obviously, it's very different
from summer,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but I find that the the landscapes
of Mont-Saint-Pierre in winter

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
are even more impressive
than in summer.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
After a nice snowfall,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
snow has a way of carving
the mountains.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It really is stunning, magnificent.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's winter, gotta take advantage of it
to play outside.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There's snowshoeing,
cross-country skiing, snowboarding,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
skishoeing, hiking...

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You can just go outside to walk
on the beach,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
take a long walk
around the village.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Even that is magnificent.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Mont Saint-Pierre is not
a mountain like the others.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You can access it easily,
and fairly quickly.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It's a short trek.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Once you get to the top,
you have this unique scenery

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
with the river on one side,
and the valley floor on the other.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Depending on the snowfall
and the current temperature,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
the scenery changes non-stop.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
They built a new walkway,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and the vista
is really exceptional.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Whether you go up every day
or just once in a while,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
there's always a beautiful surprise
waiting for you up there!
