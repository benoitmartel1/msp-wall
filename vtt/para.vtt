00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.802
Hey there!
Mark Boucher, paraglider pilot.

2
00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:04.571
Welcome
to my mountain.

3
00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.248
I've been flying here for 26 years,

4
00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:18.251
and I've always been intrigued
by the mountain and flying.

5
00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:20.954
I'm a thrill seeker
and an adrenaline junkie.

6
00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:23.189
So I told myself
I absolutely, absolutely,

7
00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.558
had to learn
how to practice this sport.

8
00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:27.227
When you're
up in the air,

9
00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:28.128
you don't think about
anything else

10
00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:29.829
besides your flight,
you know?

11
00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:31.931
It really is a special moment
just for you

12
00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:34.200
to take your mind off everything.

13
00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.736
That gives you energy
and, at the same time,

14
00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:37.837
it's just good fun.

15
00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:39.506
You're up in the air,
flying.

16
00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.141
Just like a bird.

17
00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:42.809
I like flying in Mont-Saint-Pierre

18
00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.911
because it's one of the most beautiful mountains in Canada

19
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:46.079
for free flight.

20
00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:47.447
There's the sea below,

21
00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:49.182
mountains all around,

22
00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:50.650
it's accessible...

23
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:54.154
that adrenaline rush you get
when you take off, you know?

24
00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.689
“It's going to be hard
at first

25
00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:57.957
because you're not moving.

26
00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:59.859
Oh! Oh! And then,
it's going to kick in.”

27
00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.361
With the professionals
we have,

28
00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:04.330
with all the training they have
and their experience,

29
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.499
it's really easy to do, you know?

30
00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:08.635
It comes naturally.

31
00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:10.270
It's a lot easier than you think.

32
00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.407
Shall we?
