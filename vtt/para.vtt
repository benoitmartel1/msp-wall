Hey there!
Mark Boucher, paraglider pilot.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome
to my mountain.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I've been flying here for 26 years,

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and I've always been intrigued by
the mountain and flying.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm a thrill seeker

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and an adrenaline junkie.

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So I told myself
I absolutely

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
had to learn
how to practice this sport.

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
When you're
up in the air,

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
you don't think about
anything else besides your flight.

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's a special moment just for you

12
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
to take your mind off everything.

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
That gives you energy
and it's just good fun.

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You're up in the air,
flying.

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Just like a bird.

16
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I like flying in Mont-Saint-Pierre

17
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
because it's one of the most
beautiful mountains in Canada

18
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
for free flight.

19
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
There's the sea below,

20
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
mountains all around,

21
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
it's accessible...

22
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that adrenaline rush you get
when you take off.

23
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
“It's going to be hard
at first

24
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
because you're not moving.

25
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And then, it's going to kick in.”

26
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
With the training and experience
our professionals have

27
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
it's really easy to do.

28
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It comes naturally.

29
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It's a lot easier than you think.

30
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Shall we?
